*1st commit (10.01.2022-24.01.2022):
	Fork the repository
	Faced a problem when running the program for the first time because of the codec needed to be specific
	Fixed by specifing the codec using Fourcc
	Run the Video Learning
	Generate 10 different sets of videos (circle, rectangle, triangle) with different angles, start from 36 to 360
	Learning videos with Run 1
	Document the experiment results (accuracy)

*2nd commit (25.01.2022-07.02.2022)
	Adding a Trim of Music Video from Youtube
	Learning videos with Run 2
	Document the angles experiment results (accuracy)
	Create pictures from the video
	Try to recall videos using pictures
	Adding Documentation Folder 
	Can not recall videos
	->Need to drag the frame from its own video as an input so the program can recall the video properly
	Can not open the output videos
	->Need to change the video player (from default to MPC-HC) to watch the output videos 
	because default player can not play the video with such small resolution (18x18) 
	Can not recall the Youtube video
	Test Youtube video's accuracy with different resolutions (changing frame width and frame height)
	-> The larger the resolution,the longer run time is required
	40x40 Resolution is the minimum resolution for the default video player to run properly 

*3rd commit (08.02.2022-21.02.2022)
	Test with maxCycle = 1000 of Run1
	Test Video Learning and recalling with different other videos
	Exploring different videos with different Video Editor (Kapwing, Adobe)
	Test with different parameters of HTM Configuration with focus on Run2
	Test different Cells per column parameters
	Test with False Global Inhibition Condition
	Test by Enable LocalAreaDensity
	Test with a few Inhibition Radius
*4th commit (22.02.02.2022-)
	Test with a new version of code with new features:
		+Separate json file containing HTM configuration
		+Separate json file containing Video configuration
	Test with SmallTrainingSet
