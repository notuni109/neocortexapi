*1st commit (10.01.2021-24.01.2021):
	Fork the repository
	Faced a problem when running the program for the first time because of the codec needed to be specific
	Fixed by specifing the codec using Fourcc
	Run the Video Learning
	Generate 10 different sets of videos (circle, rectangle, triangle) with different angles, start from 36 to 360
	Learning videos with Run 1
	Document the experiment results (accuracy)

*2nd commit (25.01.2021-07.02.2021)
	Adding a Trim of Music Video from Youtube
	Learning videos with Run 2
	Document the angles experiment results (accuracy)
	Create pictures from the video

	Adding Documentation Folder 
	Can not recall videos
	->Need to drag the frame from its own video as an input so the program can recall the video properly
	Can not open the output videos
	->Need to change the video format (from default to MPC-HC) to watch the output videos 
	because default player can not play the video with such small resolution (18x18) 
	Can not recall the Youtube video
	Test Youtube video's accuracy with different resolutions (changing frame width and frame height)
	-> The larger the resolution,the longer run time is required
*3rd commit (08.02.2021-)
	Test with maxCycle = 1000 of Run1
	Test Video Learning with different other videos
	Test with different parameters of HTM Configuration
